# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

Hyprkarl is a desktop configuration repository for CachyOS + Hyprland. It is installed once, then edited directly — the live `~/.config/` files are symlinks back into this repo, so changes here take effect immediately without a deploy step.

## Keeping Docs Current

When you change behavior, structure, or conventions, **update the documentation
in the same change** — both audiences:

- **Human-facing docs** — `README.md` and `docs/` (getting-started, themes,
  commands, configuration-map, extending, repo-conventions, shell-style,
  updating, …).
- **Agent-facing docs** — the three canonical `AGENTS.md` files: this one,
  `bin/AGENTS.md` (command authoring), and `config/ags/AGENTS.md` (the bar).
  Each adjacent `CLAUDE.md` only imports its `AGENTS.md` counterpart for Claude
  Code compatibility; keep shared guidance in `AGENTS.md`.

Out-of-date docs are worse than no docs. If a change adds an `hk-*` command,
renames a config surface, alters the theme layout, or shifts a convention, find
and update every doc that describes it. Keep the two audiences consistent with
each other.

## Setup Commands

```bash
./setup-all.sh          # Full setup: packages, dotfiles, system config
./setup-packages.sh     # Install/update packages via pacman + paru
./setup-dotfiles.sh     # Re-run GNU stow to update symlinks (refuses on a dirty config/ tree)
./setup-system.sh       # System-level config (SDDM autologin, etc.)
./uninstall.sh          # Remove all config symlinks (reverses setup-dotfiles.sh)
```

There are no build steps or package.json at the repo root — this is a pure
shell/config repo. There is no automated test suite; `tests/` holds manual,
interactive sandbox harnesses (e.g. `tests/hk-update-tui.sh`) for exercising a
command end to end without touching the live system. See `tests/README.md`.

## Releases

Releases are annotated git tags `vX.Y.Z` on `main` with a hand-written entry in
`CHANGELOG.md`; `develop` is the integration branch. See "Branches and
Releases" in `docs/repo-conventions.md` for the cut procedure. Until v1.0.0,
minor versions may include breaking changes — call them out in the changelog.

## Architecture

### Symlink Model

`setup-dotfiles.sh` uses GNU stow to symlink:
- `config/` → `~/.config/`
- `applications/` → `~/.local/share/applications/`

`bin/` is not stowed; it is added to `$PATH` directly via `config/uwsm/env`.
`vendor/wispr-flow-helper` is a git submodule (the Wispr Flow helper fork,
built by `hk-wispr-helper-install`); it is not stowed either.

Editing files in this repo edits the live running config directly. Renaming or
deleting a config file leaves a **stale symlink** (a live link pointing at a
now-missing repo file); `hk-update dotfiles` prunes them as part of its run,
and `hk-update remove-stale` does just that step.

### Hyprland Configuration

Hyprland is configured in **Lua** (`hyprland.lua`), as required since Hyprland
0.55 — hyprlang `.conf` is deprecated. The API is `hl.config{}`, `hl.bind()`,
`hl.dsp.*` (dispatchers), `hl.window_rule{}` / `hl.layer_rule{}`, `hl.monitor{}`,
`hl.env()`, `hl.gesture{}`, `hl.animation{}` / `hl.curve()`. See
https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Start/.

`config/hypr/hyprland.lua` is the entry point; it `require()`s the rest (each
module is a separate Lua scope, so an error in one file won't abort the others):

```
envs.lua, autostart.lua, monitors.lua, permissions.lua, looknfeel.lua,
animations.lua, gum.lua, windows.lua, input.lua, bindings.lua
```

It then loads the active theme last (`loadfile` of
`~/.config/hyprkarl/current/theme/hyprland.lua`), so the theme overrides win.

Keybindings are split under `config/hypr/bindings/`: `apps.lua`, `media.lua`, `windows.lua` (window management), `workspaces.lua` (workspaces/monitors/scratchpad), `system.lua` (menus, notifications, panels, power). App-specific window rules are split under `config/hypr/windows/`: `browsers.lua`, `floating.lua`, `media.lua`, `terminals.lua`, `screenshots.lua` — each required by `windows.lua`, which owns the base rules and the final `default-opacity` application.

Validate any change non-destructively with `Hyprland --verify-config` before
relaunching — a broken `hyprland.lua` has no automatic fallback.

### Theme System

Themes live in `themes/{name}/` and control Hyprland, the AGS bar, rofi,
terminals, mako, hyprlock, GTK, and Qt. Themes are meant to control **look** —
colors, fonts, spacing — not behavior. The active theme is tracked by the
symlink `config/hyprkarl/current/theme` (plus `theme.name`).

Switch themes with:
```bash
hk-theme set <theme-name>    # hyprkarl, everforest, gruvbox
```

When adding a new component that needs theming, add a corresponding file to
each theme directory. Themes can also be generated from a single color palette
with the companion
[theme generator](https://github.com/KarlJussila/hyprkarl-theme-generator)
(locally at `../theme-generator/`).

### `hk-*` Commands

All user-facing utilities are in `bin/` and follow the `hk-*` naming
convention. See `bin/AGENTS.md` for command structure, naming rules, and
authoring conventions before adding or editing one.

### Session Environment

`config/uwsm/env` sets session-wide environment variables (including
`HYPRKARL_PATH` and `$PATH`). Changes require a new Hyprland session.
`config/uwsm/default` controls `$TERMINAL`, `$EDITOR`, and `$SHELL`.
`~/.config/uwsm/env.local` holds machine-local variables and is not tracked.

## Shell Style

`bin/` scripts follow `docs/shell-style.md` — read it before writing or editing
a command. The one counterintuitive rule worth stating up front: the shebang is
`#!/bin/bash` and Bash strict mode (`set -euo pipefail`) is **intentionally
absent**, so don't add it reflexively.
