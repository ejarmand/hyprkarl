# setup-purge-noctalia.sh
# Removes the CachyOS Noctalia desktop shell and its leftover configs so
# Hyprkarl installs onto a clean base.
#
# Run this BEFORE setup-all.sh. Ordering matters in both directions:
#
#   - cachyos-hypr-noctalia hard-depends on dolphin, so packages/remove.txt
#     cannot drop dolphin until this script has run.
#   - cachyos-hypr-noctalia is the ONLY requirer of uwsm, grim and slurp, so a
#     plain `pacman -Rns` would sweep them out. Hyprkarl needs uwsm (SDDM
#     autologin launches hyprland-uwsm.desktop) but does not list it in
#     packages/pacman.txt, so it would not come back. This script re-marks them
#     explicit first to pin them in place.
#
# Not removed here: dolphin. setup-packages.sh handles it via remove.txt once
# the dependency above is gone.

# --- Constants ---
PURGE_PKGS=(cachyos-hypr-noctalia noctalia)

# Swept by -Rns but needed afterwards, and NOT restored by packages/pacman.txt.
# Marked explicit so recursive removal skips them.
#
# Only uwsm qualifies. Deliberately absent: grim and slurp are also swept, but
# hyprshot (pacman.txt) depends on both and pulls them back as proper deps.
# Pinning them here would leave them explicit forever, masquerading as orphans.
