# AGENTS.md

Guidance for working in `bin/` — the hk-* command library. Every file here is a
user-facing command, on `$PATH` directly via `config/uwsm/env`; there is no
deploy step. Full command reference: `docs/commands.md`.

## Command Structure

- **Simple command** — one script, one action. The default.
- **Dispatcher** — a command with three or more distinct actions (`hk-theme`,
  `hk-wallpaper`, `hk-update`, `hk-pkg`, `hk-fingerprint`, `hk-docker`, `hk-app`). Each
  subcommand lives as its own top-level command in the form
  `hk-<noun>-<action>`; the dispatcher is a thin router that `exec`s it.
- **`bin/lib/`** — sourced helpers shared by two or more commands (`app.sh`, `docker.sh`,
  `update.sh`). Not for single-use logic; keep that in the command itself.

## Naming

Noun-first: the thing acted on comes before the action (`hk-theme-set`,
`hk-screen-record`, `hk-icon-find`). Four deliberate exceptions where no
noun-first form reads naturally: `hk-show-done`, `hk-open-with`,
`hk-suggest-reboot`, `hk-notify-window-class`. Don't add new exceptions
without good reason.

`hk-menu-*` commands form the rofi menu tree. Membership is determined by UI
pattern (a menu-like interface), not strictly by use of rofi.

## Style

Follow `docs/shell-style.md`. Highlights: `#!/bin/bash` shebang, no
`set -euo pipefail` (intentional), guard clauses as `if` blocks, 2-space
indent, `gum log` for user-facing output in interactive commands.
`$HYPRKARL_PATH` is guaranteed by the session environment — no fallbacks
outside `lib/update.sh` and the setup scripts, which must run from a TTY.

Several scripts embed Nerd Font glyphs in menu labels (rofi entries). These
private-use-area characters are easy to drop silently when rewriting a whole
file — prefer targeted edits to full-file rewrites in the `hk-menu-*` scripts.

## Theme selection

`hk-theme-list` discovers theme directories, including the Vera variants and
the `klimt-*` and other painting themes; new themes need no command-specific
registration. `hk-theme-set`
uses the theme's `light.mode` marker to select GNOME's light preference.
Keep mode and palette choices in the theme files.
