# Command Reference

This page lists the `hk-*` commands you would normally run directly. It
does not try to document every internal script.

## Update

- `hk-update check`
  Report what would change across dotfiles, packages, and system, and which
  `hk-app` AppImages have a newer release, without making any changes.
- `hk-update all [--force|--adopt]`
  Run dotfiles, packages, system, and app updates in sequence. `--force` and
  `--adopt` are passed through to the dotfiles step.
- `hk-update apps [--dry-run] [id...]`
  Update AppImages installed with `hk-app` (same as `hk-app update`).
- `hk-update tui`
  Interactive guided update in a terminal: fetch and merge upstream (safe on a
  dirty working tree, with conflict resolution), review pending dotfile,
  package, and system changes as `delta` diffs, then apply the categories you
  select. Excludes the system package upgrade (`paru -Syu`) — see
  `hk-pkg-upgrade` for that. Launch via the update menu or
  `hk-tui-launch hk-update-tui`.
- `hk-update dotfiles`
  Re-stow config files and remove stale symlinks. Checks for conflicts first
  and aborts if any are found.
- `hk-update dotfiles --force`
  Re-stow using the adopt-and-checkout flow, overwriting any conflicting files
  in `~/.config/`. Requires a clean git working tree.
- `hk-update dotfiles --adopt`
  Adopt conflicting `~/.config/` files into the repo without overwriting them,
  then report what differs so you can review and commit or discard.
- `hk-update remove-stale`
  Remove stale hyprkarl symlinks from `~/.config/` and related directories,
  and the directories they leave empty, without restowing. Useful when cleaning up after removing
  files from the repo.
- `hk-update packages`
  Install packages newly added to the required lists, prompt to remove packages
  that were dropped or added to the removal list.
- `hk-update system`
  Re-run `setup-system.sh`.

## Menus and Launching

- `hk-menu`
  Open the main Hyprkarl menu.
- `hk-menu-launcher`
  Open the rofi app launcher.
- `hk-menu-config`
  Open the configuration menu for themes, wallpapers, and defaults.
- `hk-menu-defaults`
  Open the defaults submenu (terminal, editor, shell).
- `hk-menu-editor` / `hk-menu-shell` / `hk-menu-terminal`
  Pick a default editor, shell, or terminal directly without going through the
  defaults menu.
- `hk-menu-install`
  Open the install menu for packages, Docker services, and AppImages
  ("AppImage" prompts for an `owner/repo` or URL and runs `hk-app install`).
- `hk-menu-uninstall`
  Open the uninstall menu for packages and Docker services.
- `hk-menu-update`
  Open the update menu: "Update Hyprkarl" launches the guided `hk-update tui`,
  "Upgrade Packages" runs the system package upgrade (`hk-pkg-upgrade`),
  "Update Apps" runs `hk-app update`.
- `hk-menu-utils`
  Open the utilities submenu (toggles, screen recording, and other actions).
- `hk-menu-voice-commands`
  Open the voice command cheat sheet: the focused app's phrases first, then the
  ones that work everywhere (from `hk-voice-command --list`).
- `hk-menu-power`
  Open the power menu.
- `hk-menu-power-profile`
  Pick a `power-profiles-daemon` profile (performance / balanced / saver).
- `hk-menu-keybindings`
  Open a searchable rofi menu of all Hyprland keybindings. Pass `--print` /
  `-p` to print them to stdout instead.
- `hk-menu-calculator`
  Open `rofi-calc`. `Ctrl+Return` copies the current result to the clipboard;
  history is trimmed to five entries on exit.
- `hk-menu-icons`
  Open a fuzzy Nerd Font icon picker. Search by icon name, select an entry, and
  the glyph is copied to the clipboard. Requires the glyph data file — run
  `hk-icon-data-update` first if it is missing.
- `hk-icon-data-update`
  Download the latest Nerd Font glyph list from the upstream cheat-sheet and
  regenerate `~/.local/share/hyprkarl/data/nerdfont-glyphs.txt`. Re-run after upgrading
  Nerd Fonts to pick up new icons.

### Launching apps

## Apps (AppImages)

AppImages installed outside the package manager. Each app has a tracked config
at `config/hyprkarl/apps/<id>.conf` (key reference at the top of
`bin/lib/app.sh`) and installs to `~/.local/opt/<id>/<tag>/`, with `current`
and `previous` symlinks, a launcher at `~/.local/bin/<id>`, and a desktop entry.

- `hk-app install <owner/repo> [--channel REGEX] [--asset REGEX] [--id ID] [-- args...]`
  Install the newest GitHub release and write its config. `--channel` tracks
  tags matching a regex (e.g. `nightly`) and admits prereleases; the default is
  the newest stable release. Arguments after `--` are added to the launcher.
  The download is checked against GitHub's SHA-256 digest when the release
  publishes one; `--sha256` is rejected here, as it is for URL installs only.
- `hk-app install <url> [--sha256 HEX] [--id ID] [-- args...]`
  Install a direct AppImage URL. Manual installs are not updated.
- `hk-app install <id>`
  Install from an existing config (e.g. on a new machine).
- `hk-app update [--dry-run] [id...]`
  Update installed apps to their newest matching release, verifying GitHub's
  SHA-256 digest. Keeps the previous release and reports apps that are running
  and need a restart.
- `hk-app config-update [id...]`
  Re-apply configs to the installed release without downloading: rewrite the
  launcher and desktop entry and re-run the `post_install` command. Run after
  editing a config or whatever `post_install` builds.
- `hk-app status [id...]`
  Show installed and latest release per app.
- `hk-app rollback <id>`
  Swap to the previous release.

## Docker

- `hk-menu-docker-install`
  Open the Docker install menu.
- `hk-menu-docker-uninstall`
  Open the Docker uninstall menu.
- `hk-docker setup`
  Install Docker and Docker Compose, enable Docker, and add the user to the
  `docker` group.
- `hk-docker install <service>`
  Install a local Docker service.
- `hk-docker uninstall <service>`
  Uninstall a local Docker service.
- `hk-docker list`
  Print the supported Docker service ids.

## AGS Bar

- `hk-menu-ags`
  Open the AGS bar control menu. Shows current state for visibility, autohide,
  and exclusive zone; selecting an item toggles it.

- `hk-ags restart`
  Gracefully quit AGS, wait for the process to exit, then restart it under
  uwsm-app.
- `hk-ags start`
  Start AGS if it is not running.
- `hk-ags stop`
  Quit AGS if it is running.
- `hk-ags autohide [on|off|toggle]`

  Send an arbitrary request to the running AGS instance.

## UI Helpers

- `hk-mako-reload`
  Reload mako.
- `hk-terminal-reload`
  Reload terminal configs for supported terminals.
- `hk-workspace-swap <target_num>`
  Swap all windows between the active workspace and the target workspace, then
  focus the target. Tiled windows will be retiled on arrival.

## Media, Hardware, and Utilities

- `hk-screenshot [smart|region|window|output] [edit|save|copy]`
  Freeze the screen and take a screenshot. `smart` (the default) lets you drag
  a region or click a window or display to capture all of it; `region` only
  drags, `window` only snaps to windows and displays, and `output` takes the
  focused display. `edit` (the default) opens the capture in satty, where
  Enter copies and saves, Ctrl+C copies, Ctrl+S saves, and Esc discards.
  `save` copies and saves straight away (click the notification to edit);
  `copy` only copies. Run it again while picking to cancel. Saves to
  `HYPRKARL_SCREENSHOT_DIR`, falling back to `XDG_PICTURES_DIR`. Bound to
  `Print` (edit), `Shift+Print` (save), and `Super+Print` (display, edit).
- `hk-screen-record`
  Start or stop screen recording. Supports desktop audio, microphone audio,
  webcam overlays, and explicit resolution arguments.
- `hk-video-compress [input] [target_size] [options]`
  Two-pass compression of a video file to a target file size. Prompts via
  `gum` for missing arguments unless `--non-interactive` is set.
- `hk-picture-select [directory]`
  Open `yazi` as an image picker and print the chosen path. Defaults to
  `~/Pictures`.
- `hk-video-select [directory]`
  Open `yazi` as a video picker and print the chosen path. Defaults to
  `~/Videos`.
- `hk-nightlight [on|off|toggle]`
  Enable, disable, or toggle hyprsunset nightlight (warm color temperature +
  gamma dimming).
- `hk-caffeine`
  Toggle idle behaviors (hypridle).
- `hk-playerctl`
  Control media playback and show track notifications.
- `hk-volume`
  Adjust audio volume and show the current level.
- `hk-mic`
  Toggle microphone mute and show the current state.
- `hk-webcam`
  Open a webcam preview window.
- `hk-dictionary`
  Dictionary TUI powered by `fzf` and dict.org.
- `hk-wifi-restart`
  Unblock Wi-Fi.
- `hk-audio-restart`
  Restart the PipeWire audio service.
- `hk-btop-reload`
  Reload the running `btop` so it picks up theme changes.

## Voice Commands (Wispr Flow)

- `hk-voice-command [--dry-run] <transcript>` / `--list` / `--join-mode MODE`
  Wispr Flow's transcript hook (`WISPR_TRANSCRIPT_HOOK` in
  `config/uwsm/default`). A transcript matching a phrase in
  `config/hyprkarl/voice-commands.conf` runs its command instead of being
  pasted; anything else is pasted, joined to the previous dictation in the same
  window. `--list` prints the phrases for the focused app and everywhere.
- `hk-voice-keys <step>...`
  Send keys (`CTRL+L`, `Return`) and text (`type:TEXT`) to the focused window.
- `hk-wispr-word-add [--correction]`
  Open Wispr's "Add to vocabulary" dialog through AT-SPI, cursor in the word
  field; `--correction` sets it up as misspelling -> correct word.
- `hk-wispr-dictionary [output.csv|-]`
  Back up Wispr's personal dictionary as a CSV in Wispr's import format
  (default: `config/hyprkarl/wispr-dictionary.csv`, which is gitignored so
  personal words stay out of the repo).
- `hk-wispr-helper-install [release-dir]`
  The `post_install` hook in `config/hyprkarl/apps/wispr-flow.conf`: builds
  `wispr-flow-linux-helper` from the checkout at `WISPR_HELPER_SRC` and swaps
  it into the release (shipped helper kept as `.orig`). Rebuild and reinstall
  it with `hk-app config-update wispr-flow`.
- `hk-wispr-transcripts [--no-audio] [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [DIR]`
  Export Wispr's dictation history (raw ASR, cleaned and pasted text, audio)
  to `~/Documents/wispr-exports/` for review.
- `hk-wispr-switch [run|on|off|toggle|status]`
  Make a USB mic's hardware mute switch drive Wispr hands-free: unmuting starts
  it, muting stops it (by pressing Ctrl+Super+Space on a virtual keyboard). It
  hears the switch as exact digital silence, stays out of the way while another
  app records from the mic, and ignores software mutes. Autostart runs it
  before Wispr, whose helper only finds keyboards at launch; restart Wispr after
  restarting it. `off`/`toggle` (`Super+Alt+D`) pause it until the next login.
  The mic is `$HK_WISPR_SWITCH_SOURCE` (default: the Jounivo JV601); it logs to
  `journalctl --user -t hk-wispr-switch`.

## Internal Helpers

These `hk-*` commands exist in `bin/` but are not meant to be typed directly.
They are invoked by other scripts, keybindings, and bar widgets. Listed for
completeness so they can be discovered with grep:

- Launching glue: `hk-tui-launch`, `hk-app-restart`
- Hardware actions bound to function keys: `hk-brightness-display`,
  `hk-brightness-keyboard`, `hk-audio-switch`, `hk-battery-monitor`
- Notification and OSD helpers: `hk-battery-notify`, `hk-notify-window-class`,
  `hk-show-done`, `hk-suggest-reboot`
- Lookup helpers: `hk-battery-find`, `hk-icon-find`, `hk-cmd-present`,
  `hk-terminal-cwd`

If you need behavior one of these provides from your own script, source or
shell it out the same way the existing callers do.
