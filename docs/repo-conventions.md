# Repo Conventions

This page covers Hyprkarl’s general editing conventions beyond the shell
guidelines in [Shell Style](shell-style.md).

## Readability First

Hyprkarl favors direct, readable configuration over clever abstraction.

That means:

- keep the files people are likely to edit easy to find
- prefer small scripts with one clear path through them
- prefer a plain config file when that is enough
- document what changed for the user or editor when you add or change behavior

## Put Changes in the Right Layer

- `config/`
  Application config and session behavior
- `themes/`
  Theme assets and per-theme overrides
- `bin/`
  Commands meant to be run directly. Subcommands of a dispatcher (`hk-theme set`, `hk-pkg install`, …) live as their own top-level commands using the noun-first form `hk-<noun>-<action>`. The dispatcher is a thin router that `exec`s them.
- `bin/lib/`
  Shared sourced helpers used by more than one `bin/` command (`docker.sh`, `update.sh`). Single-use logic stays in the command itself.
- `templates/`
  Files copied or rendered by setup and install commands
- `applications/`
  Desktop files exposed under `~/.local/share/applications/`
- `docs/`
  Documentation for using and editing Hyprkarl

## Stateful Paths

Most files in the repo are static, but these paths represent current state:

- `config/hyprkarl/current/theme`
- `config/hyprkarl/current/theme.name`
- `config/hyprkarl/current/wallpaper`

If you change theme or wallpaper behavior, preserve that model unless you
intend to replace it.

## Branches and Releases

- `main` is the released branch: what a fresh install clones and what
  `hk-update` merges from.
- `develop` is the integration branch. Work lands there first and is merged to
  `main` when it's ready to ship.
- A release is an annotated tag `vX.Y.Z` on `main`, cut together with a
  hand-written entry in `CHANGELOG.md`:

  ```bash
  git checkout main && git merge develop
  # move the Unreleased notes under a new version heading in CHANGELOG.md, commit
  git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Hyprkarl vX.Y.Z"
  git push origin main vX.Y.Z
  ```

- Until v1.0.0, minor versions may include breaking changes; the changelog
  calls them out explicitly.

`hk-update tui` shows the current version (`git describe`) in its intro, so an
update reads as a move between releases rather than between commit hashes.

## Stow Behavior

Files under `config/` and `applications/` are exposed through GNU Stow.

- editing an existing tracked file needs no extra step
- adding a new tracked file (or removing one) requires re-stowing with
  `hk-update dotfiles`

Do not treat `setup-dotfiles.sh` as a normal maintenance command. It belongs to
the initial setup flow and is too aggressive for routine refreshes.
