# Extending Hyprkarl

This guide covers personal customization: scripts, hooks, menu entries,
keybindings, and Quickshell interfaces. These live outside the checkout and
survive Hyprkarl updates. No Git branch is needed.

For changes to Hyprkarl's shipped implementation, start with
[Repo conventions](repo-conventions.md).

## Choose the right place

| What you want to change | Personal location |
|---|---|
| Application preferences | The application's own configuration directory; see the [ownership table](configuration-map.md#application-configuration) |
| Hyprland settings and keybindings | `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.local.lua` |
| Quickshell behavior, modules, and bar layout | `~/.config/quickshell/settings/shell.json` |
| Menu entries | `~/.config/quickshell/settings/menu.json` |
| Quickshell widgets and independent interfaces | `~/.config/quickshell/custom/` |
| Theme values, templates, and assets | `~/.config/hyprkarl/themes/<name>/` |
| Lifecycle hooks | `~/.config/hyprkarl/hooks/<event>.d/` |
| Personal commands | `~/.local/bin/` |

The examples use the usual `~/.config/` location. If you set `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`,
use that directory instead.

## Ask an AI agent

Coding agents such as Claude Code and Codex tend to configure Linux the usual
way: editing whatever file they find, setting variables in `~/.bashrc`, or
installing another bar or notifier. On Hyprkarl that breaks updates or
quietly stops Hyprkarl's defaults from reaching you. `hk-update apply`
therefore links a `hyprkarl` skill into the skill folders agents read
(`~/.agents/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`), creating them if
needed, so an agent you install later has it from the start.
Agents load it when you ask for a desktop change, and it sends each change to
the personal file meant for it. A skill of your own named `hyprkarl` is left
alone, and `uninstall.sh` removes the links.

## Add a personal command

Put an executable script in `~/.local/bin/`. Hyprkarl's session already adds
that directory to `PATH`, so menus and keybindings can call it by name.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
$EDITOR ~/.local/bin/my-command
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/my-command
```

Give it the appropriate shebang, such as `#!/bin/bash` or
`#!/usr/bin/env python3`. Use Bash for command orchestration and Python for
structured data or substantial parsing.

A personal command with the same name as an `hk-*` command replaces it, because
`~/.local/bin` comes first on `PATH`. Keybindings, menus, Hypridle, and other
commands then run yours.

You can also add personal desktop entries under
`~/.local/share/applications/` to expose applications or scripts in the
launcher.

## Add a lifecycle hook

Hooks run after you log in, a complete update, a theme switch, or a
wallpaper change. Put executable files in the corresponding
`~/.config/hyprkarl/hooks/<event>.d/` directory. The event names are
`login`, `post-update`, `theme-set`, and `wallpaper-set`.

For example, to reload an application after switching themes:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/hyprkarl/hooks/theme-set.d
$EDITOR ~/.config/hyprkarl/hooks/theme-set.d/10-reload-my-app
chmod +x ~/.config/hyprkarl/hooks/theme-set.d/10-reload-my-app
```

Hooks run in lexical filename order, inherit the action's environment, and
receive no arguments. Use `hk-theme current` or the
[active theme files](#use-the-active-theme-in-personal-code) when a hook needs
the current selection. A failed hook is reported after the remaining hooks
run; the theme or wallpaper change has already completed.

## Add a menu action

Create `~/.config/quickshell/settings/menu.json` with the entries you want to
add or change. For example, this adds a personal command to Utilities:

```json
{
  "entries": {
    "utilities.my-command": {
      "parent": "utilities",
      "order": 25,
      "label": "My command",
      "action": { "type": "command", "command": "my-command" }
    }
  }
}
```

Valid edits apply live. Keep longer commands in personal scripts and reference
them here. Menu command actions already launch through `uwsm-app --`.

Entries can also open submenus or Quickshell interfaces. Existing entries can
be renamed, reordered, or hidden by ID. See
[Menu configuration](menu-configuration.md) for these options and dynamic
entry providers.

## Customize Hyprland

Put personal Hyprland settings in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.local.lua`. Hyprkarl creates it once and
loads it after the shipped settings, active theme, and generated display
layout, so it can change selected values without copying the shipped
configuration:

```lua
hl.config({
    input = {
        kb_layout = "us,fi",
        sensitivity = 0,
    },
})
```

Keybindings go in the same file:

```lua
hl.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + G", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("uwsm-app -- my-command"), {
    description = "My command",
})
```

Descriptions appear in the keybindings menu. Binding and window-rule calls
add to the existing configuration; use `hl.unbind()` before replacing a
shipped binding. The files under `defaults/hypr/` are useful examples. To split
your settings across files, `require` them from `~/.config/hypr/` under names
that differ from Hyprkarl's modules.

Validate with `Hyprland --verify-config` before reloading. See the
[Hyprland configuration map](configuration-map.md#hyprland) for each module's
purpose and display configuration.

## Extend Quickshell

Most shell changes are settings in `~/.config/quickshell/settings/shell.json`;
see [Shell configuration](shell-configuration.md). That includes [command
widgets](shell-configuration.md#command-widgets), which put a script's output
or a button in the bar without any QML. For more, write QML:

- a **QML widget** renders and behaves however you like inside the bar;
- an **application-wide root** adds windows of its own, a different bar, or
  replacements for built-in parts.

The shell runs from `~/.config/quickshell/`, where Hyprkarl's files are links
next to your `settings/` and `custom/`. Your QML can import any of it, such as
`import ui.modal` or `import "../modules/lock"` from `custom/`. It runs inside
the shell with no sandbox; an error in it is logged and leaves the rest of the
shell running. Run `hk-shell restart` after editing a QML file.

### QML widgets

Put the file under `~/.config/quickshell/custom/modules/` and place it in a
bar section with `kind: "qml"`. `settings` is yours to define:

```json
{
  "id": "greeting",
  "kind": "qml",
  "source": "Greeting.qml",
  "settings": { "text": "Hello", "command": "notify-send Hello" }
}
```

```qml
import QtQuick

Item {
    id: root
    required property var context
    property string tooltip: "Run greeting"

    implicitWidth: label.implicitWidth
    implicitHeight: label.implicitHeight

    Text {
        id: label
        anchors.centerIn: parent
        text: root.context.settings.text
        color: root.context.theme.palette.foreground
        font.family: root.context.theme.typography.uiFamily
    }

    MouseArea {
        anchors.fill: parent
        onClicked: root.context.runCommand(root.context.settings.command)
    }
}
```

Each monitor's bar gets its own instance. `context` provides:

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `widgetId`, `settings` | The widget's `id` and `settings` from `shell.json` |
| `theme` | The live theme; see [Theme values](#theme-values) |
| `edge` | `top` or `bottom` |
| `output`, `barWindow` | The monitor's name and the bar window |
| `runCommand(command)` | Runs a command with `HYPRKARL_OUTPUT` set |
| `togglePanel(trigger, component)`, `closePanel()` | Opens content in the bar's popup panel, attached to `trigger` |
| `launchPanelCommand(command)` | Closes the panel, then runs a command |

The widget may also set `tooltip` (text shown on hover), `tooltipSuppressed`,
and `widgetVisible` (false hides it entirely; plain `visible` only hides its
content).

### Application-wide QML

Point `userRoot.source` at a file under `~/.config/quickshell/custom/`. The
shell loads it once, so it can hold your own windows (one per monitor with
`Variants`), global state, or a whole bar. To replace the built-in bar, also
turn it off:

```json
{
  "modules": { "bar": false },
  "userRoot": { "source": "Extensions.qml", "settings": {} }
}
```

Its root declares `required property var context`, which provides:

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `configuration`, `settings` | The merged `shell.json`, and its `userRoot.settings` |
| `theme` | The live theme; see [Theme values](#theme-values) |
| `surfaceName`, `surfaceOutput`, `surfaceParameters` | The open surface, if any |
| `openSurface(name, output, parameters)` | Opens a surface unless one is open |
| `replaceSurface(...)`, `toggleSurface(...)` | Opens it in place of the current one, or closes it if it is the current one |
| `pushSurface(...)`, `backSurface()` | Opens one that can return to the current one, and returns |
| `closeSurface()` | Closes the current surface |

A **surface** is one focused interface open on one monitor at a time: a menu,
the launcher, or one of yours. A menu entry opens one by name:

```json
{ "type": "surface", "surface": "user.dashboard", "parameters": { "section": "weather" } }
```

Your root sees `surfaceName` change to `user.dashboard` and shows its window.
`Modal` from `ui.modal` does the window part, matching the shell's own menus,
including keyboard navigation:

```qml
import QtQuick
import Quickshell
import ui.modal

Scope {
    id: root
    required property var context

    Modal {
        context: root.context
        name: "user.dashboard"
        title: "Dashboard"
        subtitle: root.context.surfaceParameters.section ?? ""

        body: Component {
            Text {
                text: "Personal content"
                color: root.context.theme.menu.foreground
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`Modal` opens on the surface's monitor whenever the surface has its `name`,
and offers `open(output, parameters)`, `replace`, `toggle`, and `close`. Use a
`user.` prefix to avoid Hyprkarl's names. Set `dismissAction` to run something
other than closing on Escape or an outside click. Controls with
`activeFocusOnTab: true` join its keyboard navigation; give one
`property string navigationSection` to group it, and
`property bool navigationSelected: true` to make it the one keyboard entry
lands on.

A replacement bar can tell notifications where it is, so they keep sitting
against it, with a root function:

```qml
function notificationPosition(outputName: string): var {
    return { "edge": "top", "extent": 30, "connected": true, "reachesSide": true }
}
```

`extent` is the bar's current height from that edge, `connected` joins the
notification border to the bar's, and `reachesSide` sharpens the shared
corner. Return `null` for the default position. It is a normal QML binding, so
an animated bar can return its live height.

### Notification icons

A notification icon with `"kind": "component"` (see [Shell
configuration](shell-configuration.md#notifications)) is a small QML drawing
under `~/.config/quickshell/custom/icons/`. Its root is an `Item` with writable
`progress` and `theme` properties. `progress` carries a notification's
`int:value` hint from 0 to 100, or -1 without one.

### Theme values

`context.theme` reads the active theme's `shell` values by group, such as
`theme.palette.accent` or `theme.panel.padding`; see
[Themes](themes.md#shell-appearance). `theme.values` is the whole document,
so a personal theme can carry values for your own QML, for example
`theme.values.extensions.dashboard.background` from an `extensions` group you
add under `shell` in `theme.yaml`.

## Replace a built-in

Any built-in part of the desktop can be replaced, by your own QML or by
another program such as Rofi or Waybar, without editing Hyprkarl's files.
Keybindings, menus, and bar widgets reach each part through an `hk-*` command,
so a replacement only has to take over those commands:

1. **Switch the built-in off** under `modules` in `shell.json`, then run
   `hk-shell restart`.
2. **Start the replacement at login** if it runs all the time, in an
   `hl.on("hyprland.start", ...)` block in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.local.lua`,
   launched with `uwsm app -- <program>`.
3. **Take over its commands.** A script with the same name in `~/.local/bin/`
   runs instead of Hyprkarl's for every caller. For example,
   `~/.local/bin/hk-shell-launcher` makes `SUPER + SPACE` and every other
   launcher shortcut open Rofi:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   exec rofi -show drun
   ```

4. **Repoint menu entries** that open a built-in directly: `main.launch`,
   `wallpaper.select`, and `wallpaper.remove`. Give them a `command` action in
   your `menu.json`.

| Built-in | Switch | Commands to take over |
|---|---|---|
| Bar | `bar` | None; start your bar at login |
| Application launcher | `applications` | `hk-shell-launcher` |
| Open-with chooser | `applications` | `hk-shell-open-with` |
| Menu | `menu` | `hk-shell-menu` |
| Calculator | `calculator` | `hk-shell-calculator` |
| Wallpaper picker | `wallpaper` | `hk-shell-wallpaper` |
| Notifications | `notifications` | `hk-shell-notifications`; start your notification daemon at login |
| OSD | `osd` | `hk-shell-osd` |
| Polkit prompt | `polkit` | None; start your polkit agent at login |
| Lock screen | None | `hk-lock` |
| Idle and suspend | None; run `systemctl --user mask hypridle.service` | Start your idle daemon at login |
| Wallpaper program | None | `hk-wallpaper-init` (starts it at login) and `hk-wallpaper-set` |
| Everything Hyprkarl starts at login | None | `hk-autostart`; your version then owns all of it, including what later updates add |

A QML replacement can skip step 3. The `hk-shell` commands talk to the shell
through named IPC targets, and once a built-in is switched off, your
[application-wide QML](#application-wide-qml) can answer its target instead:

```qml
import Quickshell.Io

IpcHandler {
    target: "launcher"

    function open(output: string): bool { /* show your launcher */ return true }
    function toggle(output: string): bool { /* ... */ return true }
    function close(): void { /* ... */ }
}
```

`output` names the monitor to open on; an empty string means the focused
one. The targets and their methods:

| Target | Methods |
|---|---|
| `launcher` | `open(output)`, `toggle(output)`, `close()` |
| `openWith` | `open(output, path)`, `close()` |
| `menu` | `open(output, menu)`, `toggle(output, menu)`, `close()` |
| `calculator` | `open(output)`, `toggle(output)`, `close()` |
| `wallpaper` | `open(output, action)`, `close()`; `action` is `set` or `remove` |
| `notifications` | `dismiss()`, `dismissAll()`, `toggleSilenced()`, `restore()` |
| `osd` | `volume(percent, muted)`, `output(percent, muted, description)`, `microphone(muted)`, `display(percent)`, `keyboard(percent)`, `media(action, percent, title, artist)` |

The menu entries that open the launcher or wallpaper picker request a
[surface](#application-wide-qml) by that name, so a QML root can handle those
too, by watching `surfaceName`.

## Use the active theme in personal code

Author personal themes or sparse overlays under
`~/.config/hyprkarl/themes/<name>/`, then apply them with `hk-theme set <name>`.
See [Themes](themes.md) for values, template replacements, and assets.

Personal QML receives the active theme through its context, including custom
values in `context.theme.values`. Scripts and other applications can read
generated files through
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/hyprkarl/current/theme/`; the generated
`theme.yaml` contains the resolved values. The sibling `current/wallpaper`
selects the active wallpaper. Edit theme sources and rebuild rather than
editing generated files. Use a `theme-set` hook when your application needs
an explicit reload.

The Starship prompt already follows the theme: keep your layout in
`~/.config/starship.toml`, refer to the theme palette's color names, and run
`hk-starship-reload` after editing it. See [Starship
prompt](themes.md#starship-prompt).
