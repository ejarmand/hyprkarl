# Updating Hyprkarl

An update has two steps: review what is coming, then apply it. Your personal
configuration lives outside the checkout, so an update never touches it.

```bash
hk-update all
```

This runs `hk-update sync`, then `hk-update apply`, then `hk-update apps`,
then your `post-update` hooks, and stops at the first failure. Its review asks whether to apply the
update now; answering no stops before anything changes. When new commits are waiting, an update
icon appears in the bar; clicking it, or the update menu entry, runs the same
command in a terminal. `hk-version` prints the installed release. System packages are separate: `hk-pkg-upgrade` runs `paru -Syu`.

## Review: `hk-update sync`

`sync` fetches the configured branch, shows what the update adds to
`CHANGELOG.md` and the incoming commits, and asks whether to stage that exact
revision. Staging records it in XDG state; nothing in the checkout changes
yet. It needs a clean checkout on the configured branch. Running `sync` again
reviews a newer revision.

Fresh installs follow `origin/main`. To follow `develop` instead:

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/hyprkarl
git remote set-branches origin '*'
git fetch origin
git switch -c develop
git config hyprkarl.updateBranch develop
hk-update all
```

The install clone fetches only `main`, so `set-branches` lets `fetch` see the
other branches. The new local branch starts at the commit you already have,
and `hk-update all` brings it forward like any update. Set
`hyprkarl.updateRemote` to follow a remote other than `origin`.

## Apply: `hk-update apply`

`apply` brings the machine to the staged revision:

1. stops Quickshell, which runs from the checkout;
2. fast-forwards to the staged revision, and checks out the commits it pins
   for any submodule already fetched (the Wispr Flow helper);
3. installs new required packages and reviews retired ones
   (`hk-update packages`);
4. runs pending migrations;
5. copies starting configs for applications you have none of
   (`hk-config-seed`);
6. restows shipped links, removes stale ones, and links the agent skill;
7. rebuilds the selected theme;
8. restores the wallpaper, reloads Hyprland, terminals, and Btop, and
   rebuilds the Starship prompt;
9. starts Quickshell again, whether or not the steps succeeded.

The applied revision is recorded only when every step succeeds. If one fails,
the staged revision stays staged: fix the problem and run `hk-update apply`
again. Steps that already finished are safe to repeat.

With nothing staged, `apply` reapplies the current checkout. Use that to repair
missing links, rebuild the theme, or apply a custom branch you merged by hand.

### Stow conflicts

An update does not overwrite a real file at a path Hyprkarl links.
`hk-update check` and `apply` list any such conflict; move or rename the file
and run `apply` again. Only the installer moves them aside itself, into
`~/.local/state/hyprkarl/replaced-configs-<date>/`.

## Packages: `hk-update packages`

`apply` runs this, and you can run it alone. It compares
`packages/pacman.txt`, `aur.txt`, and `remove.txt` with what it recorded last
time. Missing required packages install automatically, together with a full
system upgrade, since installing from an out-of-date package database fails.
A package that provides a required one, such as its `-git` build, counts as
installed. Packages dropped from the lists or added to `remove.txt` appear once in a checklist, all selected;
uncheck any you want to keep. The comment on a `remove.txt` line is the reason
shown. Escape cancels without recording anything. Once reviewed, a removal is
not offered again, even if you kept the package. A retired package that another
installed package still needs is not offered; Hyprkarl marks it as a
dependency instead, so pacman removes it once nothing needs it.

## Apps: `hk-update apps`

`hk-update all` runs this after `apply`, and you can run it alone; it is the
same as `hk-app update`. It updates AppImages installed with `hk-app` (see the
[command reference](commands.md#apps-appimages)). Unlike the other steps it
has no recorded state: it compares each app's installed release with GitHub,
installs the newest matching release, and keeps the previous one for
`hk-app rollback`. `--dry-run` only reports. Running apps keep their old
version until you restart them.

## Migrations

Some updates need a one-time change on each machine: enabling a service,
writing a file under `/etc`, or converting a renamed setting in your personal
config. These are numbered scripts in `migrations/`. `apply` runs the ones this
machine has not run yet, in order, after packages and before configuration.
Each is recorded only when it succeeds, so a failed one runs again on the next
`apply`. Scripts that change the system ask for your password through `sudo`.

## What updates keep stable

From 1.0, these are promises. An update that changes one is a breaking change:
the changelog says so and how to adapt, and where Hyprkarl can convert your
files itself, a migration does it.

- **Where personal files live:** `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.local.lua` and the
  Hypr tools' `*.local.conf`, the terminals' `local.*` files,
  `~/.config/quickshell/settings/` and `custom/`,
  `~/.config/hyprkarl/themes/` and `hooks/`, and `~/.config/uwsm/env.local`.
- **The documented settings** in [Shell configuration](shell-configuration.md)
  and [Menu configuration](menu-configuration.md), and Hypridle's variables.
- **What personal QML relies on:** the context members, `ui.modal.Modal`, and
  the IPC targets and methods in
  [Extending Hyprkarl](extending-hyprkarl.md#replace-a-built-in).
- **The commands in the [command reference](commands.md)** and the hook event
  names.
- **Theme keys outside `shell`:** `mode`, `desktop`, the palette groups
  (`base`, `ansi`, `bright`, `accent`, `status`, `ui`), `typography`,
  `metrics`, `motion`, and `wallpaper`.

Everything else can change in any release: the `shell` theme keys (detailed
shell appearance; renames are still noted in the changelog), commands not in
the reference, shell QML that the extension docs do not name, and Hyprkarl's
own files in the checkout.

## Versions

Releases are tags `vX.Y.Z` on `main`, numbered by what they mean for you:

- **Major** (`2.0.0`) breaks one of the promises above. The changelog says how
  to adapt, and a migration converts your files where it can.
- **Minor** (`1.1.0`) adds something without breaking anything: a command,
  setting, widget, theme, or hook event. Changes to things outside the
  promises, such as the `shell` theme keys or the default bar layout, also
  come in minor releases.
- **Patch** (`1.0.1`) fixes or adjusts what is already there, with nothing new
  to learn or configure.

`hk-version` prints the installed version. On a release it is the tag
(`v1.0.1`). Between releases, on `develop` or a custom branch, it is the last
tag, the number of commits since, and the current commit: `v1.0.1-3-g1a2b3c4`
is three commits after v1.0.1. A trailing `-dirty` means tracked files in the
checkout have uncommitted changes.

## Custom branches

You do not need a branch for personal configuration. If you maintain changes
to Hyprkarl itself on a branch, `sync` will not merge for you: fetch and merge
or rebase with Git, then run `hk-update apply`.

## Checking and cleanup

`hk-update check` reports, without changing anything, the staged revision, the
last applied revision, Stow conflicts, package changes waiting for review,
pending migrations, and which `hk-app` AppImages have a newer release (this
part queries GitHub).

`hk-update remove-stale` removes broken links into the checkout. `apply` does
this too.

## Update state

```text
~/.local/state/hyprkarl/update/
  configuration.revision    last revision applied successfully
  pending-source.revision   revision staged by sync
  packages.json             package lists as last applied and reviewed
  migrations/<id>           one file per migration that has run
```

`uninstall.sh` deletes this directory. Keep personal configuration out of it.
