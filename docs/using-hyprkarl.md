# Using Hyprkarl

This page covers the standard ways to use Hyprkarl through menus, keybindings,
and commands.

## Main Menus

The main menu is:

```bash
hk-menu
```

You can open it from the terminal, from the Hyprkarl button in the bar, or
with `SUPER + ALT + SPACE`.

Its top-level sections are:

- `Launch`
  App launcher
- `Install`
  Package, Docker, and AppImage install menus
- `Uninstall`
  Package uninstall menus
- `Utilities`
  Toggles, screen recording, and other utility actions
- `Config`
  Themes, wallpapers, defaults, and other quick settings
- `Power`
  Lock, suspend, reboot, and shutdown actions

The menus can also be run directly through the `hk-menu-*` commands in
`bin/`.

## Common Keybindings

Some common keybindings are:

- `SUPER + ALT + SPACE`
  Open the main Hyprkarl menu
- `SUPER + SPACE`
  Open the app launcher
- `SUPER + ESCAPE`
  Open the power menu
- `SUPER + K`
  Search keybindings
- `SUPER + CTRL + A`
  Open audio controls
- `SUPER + CTRL + B`
  Open Bluetooth controls
- `SUPER + CTRL + W`
  Open Wi-Fi controls
- `SUPER + CTRL + T`
  Open `btop`

Keybindings are defined in `config/hypr/bindings/`. The keybindings menu reads
them directly from those files.

## Themes

The usual way to switch themes is `Hyprkarl Menu -> Config -> Theme`, but you
can also run:

```bash
hk-theme set <theme-name>
```

When the theme changes, Hyprkarl:

- updates `config/hyprkarl/current/theme`
- updates `config/hyprkarl/current/theme.name`
- updates the wallpaper state
- updates GNOME and QT themes
- reloads Hyprland, mako, terminals, `btop`, and the bar

Some changes may not take effect everywhere immediately, but most of the theme
switch happens right away.

See [Themes](themes.md) for the full architecture.

## Wallpapers

Each theme has its own `wallpapers/` directory. The current wallpaper is tracked
through `config/hyprkarl/current/wallpaper`.

The usual way to manage wallpapers is `Hyprkarl Menu -> Config -> Wallpaper`, but you can also run:

```bash
hk-wallpaper set <filename>
hk-wallpaper cycle
hk-wallpaper add /path/to/image.png
hk-wallpaper remove <filename>
```

You can also add wallpapers from yazi with its `Set as wallpaper` action.

## Defaults: Terminal, Editor, Shell

The usual way to change these is `Hyprkarl Menu -> Config -> Defaults`.

The defaults commands are:

- `hk-default-terminal <terminal>`
  Install a terminal if needed and make it the default terminal.
- `hk-default-editor <editor>`
  Install an editor if needed and make it the default editor.
- `hk-default-shell <shell>`
  Install a shell if needed and make it the login shell.

Shell changes take effect on the next login.

## Package and App Installation

Install sources are:

- Pacman:
  `hk-pkg-install-tui`
- AUR:
  `hk-pkg-install-tui --aur`
- Flatpak:
  `hk-pkg-install-tui --flatpak`
- Docker services:
  `hk-menu-docker-install`
- AppImages (GitHub owner/repo or URL):
  `hk-app install <owner/repo|url>`

The package menus use `fzf` to search available packages.

For normal package management, it is usually simpler to use the package managers
directly: `pacman`, `yay` (or `paru`), and `flatpak`.

`hk-pkg` exists as a convenience layer when you want one command shape
across pacman, AUR, and Flatpak, or when you want to script against that
interface:

- `hk-pkg install ...`
- `hk-pkg remove ...`
- `hk-pkg missing ...`
- `hk-pkg present ...`

Add `--flatpak` for Flatpak app ids.

## Docker Services

Hyprkarl's Docker support is limited to four predefined local service stacks:
`traefik`, `kiwix`, `degoog`, and `searxng`. It is not a general Docker
container management interface.

Docker services are managed with:

- `hk-docker setup`
- `hk-docker install <service>`
- `hk-docker uninstall <service>`

Installed services keep their files under `~/.traefik`, `~/.kiwix`,
`~/.degoog`, and `~/.searxng`.

## TUIs and Utility Commands

Some Hyprkarl commands open TUIs and reuse an existing window when one is
already open:

- `hk-audio-launch`
- `hk-bluetooth-launch`
- `hk-wifi-launch`

Common utility commands include:

- `hk-screen-record`
- `hk-nightlight`
- `hk-caffeine`
- `hk-playerctl`
- `hk-ags restart`
- `hk-audio-restart`
- `hk-wifi-restart`

[Command Reference](commands.md).
