# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working on the AGS bar.

## What This Is

AGS (Aylur's GTK Shell) bar for Hyprland. TypeScript + TSX compiled and run by the `ags` CLI. `app.ts` is the entrypoint; everything under `bar/` is the bar implementation.

## Goals

Optimize every change for readability first. The bar has two working layers,
and each should stay approachable for its audience:

- **Configuration layer** — someone with minimal technical context should be
  able to add, remove, or reposition widgets by editing
  `bar/config/layout.config.ts` (also home to bar-level toggles: `edge`,
  `autohide`, `exclusive`, and island appearance via `corners`, `borders`,
  `dividers`), adjust widget behavior in `bar/config/widgets.config.ts`, and
  adjust styling through `bar/theme.scss`.
- **Implementation layer** — new widget kinds, primitives, and layout code
  under `bar/`.

Keep the configuration entry points stable. If an option is too low-level for
most users, hide it behind an internal default instead of expanding the main
config surface.

## Commands

```bash
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit over the bar sources (catches type errors)
npm run bundle:check   # Confirm AGS can bundle app.ts (writes to /tmp)
npm run check          # typecheck + bundle:check — run this before calling a change done
```

There is no dev server. The live bar reloads when AGS is restarted (`hk-ags restart`).

`ags bundle` transpiles with esbuild, which strips types without checking them —
so bundling alone never catches type errors; they show only as editor squiggles.
`npm run typecheck` runs a real `tsc` and is the source of truth. It filters out
errors originating in AGS's own bundled library sources (`/usr/share/ags`,
`gnim`), which our imports pull in and `skipLibCheck` can't suppress; the filter
lives in `typecheck.sh`.

There is no test suite — `widgets.config.ts` is type-checked at edit time via
the `WidgetDefinitions` union, and `assertWidgetsExist` performs the only
runtime validation at bar mount. If you add genuinely tricky stateful behavior,
add a targeted test alongside it; don't reintroduce a generic test layer.

### Dev environment (`node_modules` + `@girs`)

Both are gitignored and never committed; they're generated in **this repo dir**,
which is the single source of truth — `~/.config/ags/{node_modules,@girs}` are
just stow symlinks back here. `setup-dotfiles.sh` builds them before stowing:
`npm install` creates `node_modules` (the `ags`/`gnim` entries are recorded as
links in `package-lock.json`, so no registry fetch — and they resolve to
**relative** symlinks, which matters: stow aborts on absolute ones), and `ags
types` generates `@girs`. On a fresh clone, run `npm install` + `ags types -d .`
— or just rerun `setup-dotfiles.sh` — before `npm run check` will work.

## Architecture

### Configuration pipeline

1. `bar/config/layout.config.ts` — data-only: bar edge, widget ID order, island appearance (`corners`, `borders`, `dividers`). This file is a symlink to the active theme's `bar-layout.ts`.
2. `bar/config/widgets.config.ts` — data-only: widget instances keyed by ID; `kind` picks the implementation.
3. `bar/widgets/index.ts` — flat registry that maps every `kind` to a Component plus its `defaults` object. Also exports `assertWidgetsExist`, the only runtime validation in the pipeline (catches typos in layout widget IDs and unknown kinds; everything else is TypeScript).
4. `bar/Bar.tsx` — looks up `widgets[def.kind].Component` and renders it directly. No resolve/normalize step.

Widget IDs in `layout.config.ts` are instance names, not kind names. Two IDs
with the same `kind` produce independently configured widget instances (e.g.
`battery` and `batteryCompact`) — defining multiple IDs with the same `kind` is
the supported way to expose differently configured variants of one widget.

### Widget files

Reference: `bar/widgets/_template/` — copy this folder to start a new widget.

Every widget lives in its own folder at `bar/widgets/<kind>/`, with the component entry at `<kind>/index.tsx`. That file:

1. Exports a `<Kind>Config` type with every field optional.
2. Exports a `defaults` const matching the resolved (all-fields-present) shape.
3. Default-exports the component. Inside, `mergeConfig(defaults, config)` fills in any unspecified fields with defaults (one-level-deep merge — passing a partial nested object keeps the unspecified keys from defaults).

Simple widgets (`clock`, `cpu`, `gpu`, `menu`, `ram`, `recording`) are folders containing one or two files. Complex widgets (`audio`, `battery`, `bluetooth`, `network`, `toggle`, `tray`, `workspaces`) have sibling files for state stores, sub-components, and helpers — the folder *is* the namespace, so siblings drop the widget-name prefix (e.g. `audio/Indicator.tsx`, `audio/state.ts`, not `AudioIndicator.tsx` / `audioState.ts`). Components are `PascalCase.tsx`, utilities are `camelCase.ts`.

To register a new widget kind: import its component, defaults, and Config in `bar/widgets/index.ts`, add an entry to the `widgets` map and `ConfigByKind` map, and document its config surface in `bar/widgets/SPEC.md`.

### Shared widget utilities

- `bar/widgets/shared/types.ts` — `WidgetProps<TConfig>`, `WidgetClicks`, `WidgetFlyout`, `defaultFlyout`, and `mergeConfig(defaults, overrides)`.
- `bar/widgets/shared/useWidgetCommands.ts` — `useWidgetCommands({ commands, primaryFallback?, secondaryFallback?, tertiaryFallback?, tokens?, flyout? })`. Returns `{ execPrimary, execSecondary, execTertiary, triggerSetup }`. The single entry point for wiring clicks; pass `flyout` to opt the widget into a flyout. Tokens like `{flyout}`, `{toggle-alt}`, `{toggle-label}` are user-facing strings that can appear as `commands` values in `widgets.config.ts`.
- `bar/widgets/shared/template.ts` — `substituteTokens(template, substitutions)` for `{token}` substitution with per-line whitespace normalization.
- `bar/widgets/shared/PollingMonitor.tsx` — shared view used by `cpu/` and `ram/`; owns format selection, alt-toggle state, decimal selection, tooltip, and reveal animation.
- `bar/widgets/shared/formatters.ts`, `drawScale.ts`, `resolveCommand.ts` — small leaf helpers.
- `bar/flyout/createFlyout.tsx` — low-level flyout mount. Most widgets don't call this directly; they go through `useWidgetCommands` with a `flyout` option.

### Config surface conventions

- User-facing tooltips are plain strings (or per-state objects when the widget varies tooltip by state). Empty string = no tooltip for that state.
- Rendering metrics (`indicator.*`, `slider.*`, `switch.*`) live in each widget's `defaults`. They can be overridden in `widgets.config.ts` if needed, but the canonical config doesn't surface them — see `SPEC.md` for the full per-widget knob list.
- A widget without an entry in `widgets.config.ts` cannot be referenced from `layout.config.ts` — `assertWidgetsExist` throws a readable `Error` at bar mount, and the bar falls back to a config-error UI showing the message.

### Styling

- `bar/theme.scss` — the public styling API; edit this for spacing, radii, typography, colors. Group tokens by purpose, keep common edits near the top, prefer short semantic token names.
- `bar/styles/` — internal SCSS partials (`_layout.scss`, `_widgets.scss`, `_flyouts.scss`, `_shared.scss`).
- `style.scss` — root stylesheet that `@use`s the partials; most bar changes belong in `theme.scss`, not here.
- GTK still supplies base colors; each theme's `bar.scss` overrides the palette.

`vera-light` and `vera-dark` use primary foreground text in `bar.scss` and
cobalt accents. Both retain the default widget layout. Their source overrides
live in each theme's `templates/`; update those alongside generated styling
when changing the Vera themes so regeneration preserves the change.

The `klimt-*` themes and the other painting themes (Bonnard, Redon, Klee,
Kandinsky, Vrubel, Van Gogh, Munch, Khnopff) also retain the default widget layout and primary
foreground bar text. Their accent colors come from the painting palettes.
Update their `templates/bar.scss` and `templates/bar-layout.ts` alongside
generated files so regeneration preserves the layout and styling.

CSS class naming conventions:
- `bar-*` — bar shell and layout structure.
- `widget-*` — widget-level public hooks.
- `is-*` — state classes (`is-active`, `is-open`, `is-vertical`).

When exposing CSS hooks, prefer explicit classes from this list over selectors
that rely on widget tree structure. If a style change requires tracing several
nested selectors, that usually means the hook should be made more explicit.

### Flyouts

Flyout windows (clock calendar, audio slider, battery profiles) are in `bar/flyout/`. Widgets opt into a flyout by passing the `flyout` option to `useWidgetCommands`; it owns the open state and wires up the flyout mount, returning a `triggerSetup` to attach to the button.

### Toggle widget

`bar/widgets/toggle/` is a generic stateful switch widget. Config: `commands: { on, off, sync }` (separate shell commands for each state transition; `sync` must exit 0 when active, non-zero when inactive) and `endpoint` (AGS request identifier — external scripts call `ags request <endpoint>` to trigger a re-sync). Use this as a template for any toggle backed by an external service. The controller is keyed by `endpoint`, so multiple independent toggle instances can coexist.

## Coding Style

- TypeScript strict mode, TSX components, 2-space indent, no semicolons (Prettier defaults in `package.json`).
- `PascalCase` for component files, `camelCase` for utility modules.
- Keep `layout.config.ts` and `widgets.config.ts` data-only — no logic.
- Preserve reactive prop types (`Accessor<T> | T`) through wrapper chains; do not narrow them back to plain values.
- Comment the why where code is dense (the collapse logic in `bar/layout/islandLayout.tsx` and the GPU autosuspend throttling in `bar/widgets/gpu/state.ts` are the house style); don't add obvious comments.
- When building a new widget, copy `bar/widgets/_template/` to `bar/widgets/<kind>/`. Start with just `index.tsx`; add sibling files as needed without prefixing them with the widget name — the folder is the namespace.
